# Programming on Arduino

## Add the Espressif ESP32 arduino board library to Arduino IDE
File > Preferences > at the bottom "Additional Board Manager URLS" paste in this url
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json 
 
From there you will be able to search and add the ESP32 board library from the board library search bar. install the ESP32 library by Espressif and make sure you're using version number 2.0.5 or later. You will then be able to select your Bee Motion from the board manager.

**For sake of an example, if paired with a 1500mAh LiPo battery and triggered 20x a day with Wifi it would last for over a year!**
